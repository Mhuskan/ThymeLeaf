weâ€™ve built a Rest CRUD API using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA working with H2 Database example.

We also see that JpaRepository supports a great way to make CRUD operations and custom finder methods without need of boilerplate code.

Each Tutorial (entity) has id, title, description, level, published status.
CRUD operations are supported: create, retrieve, update, delete Tutorials.
User can search Tutorials by title.
